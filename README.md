## App Brainstorming

Favorite Applications:
- Instagram
  - Different tabs for posts, search, and reels
  - Can post pictures
- TikTok
  - Smooth scrolling elements
  - Can easily search for specific queries (such as recipes)
- New York Times Games
  - Allows users to easily access all games from one location
  - Quick and responsive interface, good for games on-the-go

An app idea I would like to build is an app that allows you to relax while also decreasing screen addiction. For example, you could pick from calming games, like planting a tree or taking care of a garden, and even puzzle-based games, but they encourage you to log off after a certain amount of time. There are features on phones that promote screen time reduction, but this would allow users to have the satisfaction of being able to use their phones while also reducing screen addiction. It would ideally have dim or reduced colors so that users aren't constantly tempted to scroll.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
